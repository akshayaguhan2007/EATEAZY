    <p class="one">EatEazy is a convenient online platform for ordering food from Mario. It offers users the ability to browse menus, customize their meals, and place orders. We going to create a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation.</p>
    <p class="two">Basically our web connects customers with Mario. With features like menus, quick search filters, and personalized recommendations, EatEazy ensures a smooth ordering process. The platform also provides options for real-time order tracking and secure payment methods. Whether you're looking for fast food, healthy options, or gourmet meals, streamlining the way people enjoy their favorite dishes.</p>
    <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
    <p class="three">EAT EAZY will enhance user experience by implementing features based on Eshwarites' feedback. Key additions include secure online payments, an intelligent recommendation system for healthier choices, allergy alerts, and spice level customization. A robust feedback mechanism will help us gather insights for continuous improvement. Additionally, we will provide nutritional information and regular updates on special offers, along with a community feature for sharing reviews, fostering engagement and belonging.</p>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p class="four">Our decision to focus on this sector stems from personal observations and experiences. During a recent visit, my friend and I encountered a lengthy wait of nearly twenty minutes in the billing section while attempting to place our order. This led me to question whether this was a unique experience or a widespread issue among fellow students. Upon hearing similar frustrations expressed by others, it became evident that extended wait times were a common challenge faced by ESHWARITES. In response to this issue, we propose a solution titled “Order Up Without Moving a Muscle!” This initiative aims to enhance the ordering experience by implementing an online system for both ordering and payment, thereby streamlining the process and improving efficiency for all users.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
